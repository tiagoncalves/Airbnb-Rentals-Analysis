# Airbnb Rentals Analysis

Welcome to the Exploratory Analysis of the Airbnb Dataset! In this project, I aim to understand Airbnb rental landscape in Boston City through exploratory analysis on the Airbnb dataset. I try to answer the below questions:

Spatial data analysis: 
-	How location ratings change across the neighbourhoods?
-	How is the Super Host distributed across the neighbourhoods?
Price and supply analysis:
-	What is the average price of Airbnb per year, and across all the years available?
-	Is there a relationship between supply and price?
-	Similarly, is there a relationship considering the different room types available?
-	Is it possible to stay at a Super host for under $100 per night?
Demand analysis: 
-	What is the total demand for Airbnb per year, and across all the years available?
-	Is there a relationship between supply, price, and demand?
-	Are there any trends in the demand for Airbnb?

The dataset used for this analysis was extract from http://insideairbnb.com/
